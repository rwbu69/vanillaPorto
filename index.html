        <p>
          I'm a vocational highschool graduate interested in web development. I
          have one year experience in Frontend Development with React,
          Typescript, and Tailwind. I've also learned and used version control
          tools such as Github and Gitlab.

        <p>
          I was previously tasked to make a layout on the frontend based from
          the Figma design that has been given to the dev team. I was also
          previously tasked to process and calculate data from an API that was
          being provided by the client and display it into a chart, a line
          graph, and many more.

              I understand the React workflow but still lacking in some areas
              such as React Hooks, React Router, and State Management.

              I understand how to utilize scripts and logics into websites, how
              to process data, and more. But at times I hit a rock point where
              I'm unable to figure out the solution for things

              I've used Tailwind in my previous working experience and also in
              my side projects. I'm quite familiar on how to use Tailwind for
              styling and responsive design. But at times I'm still stuck with
              device viewport and things related to those

              I've used version control tools such as Github and Gitlab in my
              previous work. I know the simple stuffs such as pushing, pulling,
              merging, and a little bit on how to resolve conflicts.
